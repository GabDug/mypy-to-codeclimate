Standalone tool to convert Mypy output to Code Climate format. It does not require the Code Climate CLI and is dependency-free: great for CI/CD. Keeps sane exit codes for your CI.
Additionally, can be used as a Python library.

## Why Code Climate

The Code Climate format is supported by Gitlab CI, so you can generate a Code Quality report from mypy output, and have it tracked and displayed in your Gitlab UI.

## Usage

```bash
mypy-to-codeclimate <mypy_output_file> <code_climate_output_file>
```

Example:

```bash
mypy-to-codeclimate mypy-output.txt mypy-codequality.json
```

You can replace the filename by `-` to read from stdin, write to stdout, or both.

```bash
mypy <command_args> | mypy-to-codeclimate - mypy-codequality.json
```

### Return codes

- `0`: Success, no mypy errors
- `1`: Mypy errors, codeclimate report generated
- `2`: Mypy crash (unexpected error) or mypy-to-codeclimate error (invalid arguments, invalid input file, etc.)


### Options

- `--version`: Print version and exit
- `--help`: Print help and exit

## Installation

```bash
pip install mypy-to-codeclimate
```

> The package is distributed on Pypi, so you can install it with pipx, PDM, Poetry or any other Python package manager.

## Supported versions

### Mypy versions

Tested against Mypy 1.6.1. It should work with any version of mypy that outputs the same format.

Please open an issue if you find a version of mypy that is not supported.

## Example usage in Gitlab CI

Example of a job that runs mypy and generates a codeclimate report, on a Linux runner.

Dependency management is left as an exercise for the reader.

See [Gitlab CI code-quality artifacts reference](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.html#artifactsreportscodequality)

```yaml
lint_python_mypy:
  script:
    - mypy --version
    # Disable exit on error and pipefail:
    # mypy-code-climate will return a non-zero exit code if there are errors but we want to continue the job to generate the report
    - set +eo pipefail
    - mypy <command_args> | tee mypy-output.txt"
    # Enable exit on error again
    - set -xeo
    - mypy-to-codeclimate mypy-output.txt mypy-codequality.json
  artifacts:
    when: always
    paths:
      - mypy-codequality.json
    reports:
      codequality: mypy-codequality.json
```
